# image-augmentation-with-point-clouds
Modified version from PilTiltRandomCrop implementation from fastai so it can handle multiple images and point clouds. Also some other augmentations are included for images an point clouds


Most stuff build on top of https://github.com/fastai/course-v3 and https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch.
If i used something from other people it should be labeled as such with the correct license, in case it isnt please write an issue and i will change that.
